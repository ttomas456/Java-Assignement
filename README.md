Description of the core functionality you included;
i included a search tool that lets you search through groups of text files.
i put the search tool into a GUI Graphic user interface
i added a good ranking mechanism so the strongest match is returned first â€“ and a ranking
metric (e.g. a %) is calculated and the user can see this.

o Explain what you would add if you had more time.
if i had more time i would improve the GUI,
i would make the search more smarter maybe it would save 
the words you search for,
it would complete the word your typing in (auto Completion).
