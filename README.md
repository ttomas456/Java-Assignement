# Java-Assignement
Assignment Assignment

Hello, Welcome to my Java project
Search Engine.

The Search Engine allows the user to type in words and search in that file
It will tell the user if the word is in that file
it will return with the strongest match against the search term at the top of the list
It is made to get the output in a GUI (Graphic user interface).

The List of classes, with a description.
Main method this is the main method which lets you run the program,
Main class this is where you put all your code inside the main class
private static method
the import method that were used:
(
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import javax.swing.*;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
)

IOException - which is used to catch exceptions in the program
while loop - it will loop until the program Execute everything
for and if loops
try method
GUI Graphic User interface this is used for making the app user-friendly
(
JFrame - make the frame for the user (the screen)
JPanel - is for border-layout
JLabel - is used for Prompting the user for something
JTextField - is where the user can search for different words
JButton - makes the search button
ActionListener - it will do something when you click the button
)

Description of the core functionality you included;
i included a search tool that lets you search through groups of text files.
i put the search tool into a GUI Graphic user interface
i added a good ranking mechanism so the strongest match is returned first â€“ and a ranking
metric (e.g. a %) is calculated and the user can see this.

Explain what you would add if you had more time.
if i had more time i would improve the GUI,
i would make the search more smarter maybe it would save 
the words you search for,
it would complete the word your typing in (auto Completion).
